# What is Python OS?
Python OS, Is a simple app made in Python, which is made in Python 3.14.0.
The program is like cmd.exe (A terminal) but made in Python with ChatGPT and Max (Me).
# How does it work?
(I don't know. Read the code.)
The program uses 'while True:' to keep the Terminal style, and also make the commands in the PyShell actually work.
# Why is this a thing?
This is just made for fun.
# Do I have to install anything?
Yes. You have to install 'requests' using 'pip install requests'.
## Why install 'requests'?
You must install them to run commands that require web-searching or info-lookup, for example: Weather, IP, Location and etc.
## Can you download it in PyShell?
Yes, if only I remember.. I just really don't know. ChatGPT made the program.. With me.
